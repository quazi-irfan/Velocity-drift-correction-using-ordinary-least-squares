	abstract = {This paper presents signal processing algorithms for position measurements with MEMS-accelerometers in a motion analysis system. The motion analysis system is intended to analyze the human motion with MEMS-based-sensors which is a part of embedded sensor systems for health. MEMSaccelerometers can be used to measure acceleration and theoretically the velocity and position can be derived from the integration of acceleration. However, there normally is drift in the measured acceleration, which is enlarged under integration. In this paper, the signal processing algorithms are used to minimize the drift during integration by MEMS-based accelerometer. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms improved the results a lot. The algorithm reduced the drift in one minute by about 20 meters in the simulation. It can be seen as a reference of signal processing for the motion analysis system with MEMS-based accelerometer in the future work.},

	abstract = {In recent years, MEMS inertial sensors (3D accelerometers and 3D gyroscopes) have become widely available due to their small size and low cost. Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suffer from integration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and filtering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman filter and complementary filter implementations. The quality of their estimates is illustrated using both experimental and simulated data.},

	abstract = {Research and industrial studies have indicated that small size, low cost, high precision, and ease of integration are vital features that characterize microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensors for mass production and diverse applications. In recent times, sensors like MEMS accelerometers and MEMS gyroscopes have been sought in an increased application range such as medical devices for health care to defense and military weapons. An important limitation of MEMS inertial sensors is repeatedly documented as the ease of being influenced by environmental noise from random sources, along with mechanical and electronic artifacts in the underlying systems, and other random noise. Thus, random error processing is essential for proper elimination of artifact signals and improvement of the accuracy and reliability from such sensors. In this paper, a systematic review is carried out by investigating different random error signal processing models that have been recently developed for MEMS inertial sensor precision improvement. For this purpose, an in-depth literature search was performed on several databases viz., Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, and Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library. Forty-nine representative papers that focused on the processing of signals from MEMS accelerometers, MEMS gyroscopes, and MEMS inertial measuring units, published in journal or conference formats, and indexed on the databases within the last 10 years, were downloaded and carefully reviewed. From this literature overview, 30 mainstream algorithms were extracted and categorized into seven groups, which were analyzed to present the contributions, strengths, and weaknesses of the literature. Additionally, a summary of the models developed in the studies was presented, along with their working principles viz., application domain, and the conclusions made in the studies. Finally, the development trend of MEMS inertial sensor technology and its application prospects were presented.},

@article{pang_evaluation_nodate,

	abstract = {This paper gives an evaluation of a low-cost MEMS accelerometer. The accelerometer is intended for the distance measurement of a mobile robot or platform in short duration. The distance traveled is obtained by double integration of the sensor signal with time. Bias offset drift exhibited in the acceleration signal is accumulative and the accuracy of the distance measurement can deteriorate with time due to the integration. This problem can be ﬁxed by periodic recalibration with the help of external measurements on position, velocity and attitude. These external signals can be calculated by an inertial system. A Kalman ﬁlter can use the differences between these values to provide an optimum estimate of the system error. The random bias drift of the accelerometer was found by experiment to be 2.5 mg. The bias drift rate due to temperature was 0.108 µg/s when the accelerometer was placed at room temperature. With proper compensation on gravitation, the accelerometer can be a viable solution as a short duration distance-measuring device for a mobile robot.},
